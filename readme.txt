The xLights source code is split into 2 branches:

* The version 1 branch contains the source for xLights versions 2012b and earlier.
  These versions had the various xLights modules organized as separate executables.
  Also, this branch allows playback of LOR and Vixen sequences.
  No further development is occurring in this branch.
  
* The version 2 branch contains the source for xLights versions 2012c and later.
  In these versions, all modules get built into a single executable.
  Also, in this branch only playback of xLights sequences is allowed;
  Other sequence formats must be converted to the xLights format for playback.
  This branch is being actively developed.
