xLights can be built and run on Linux, Mac OS/X, or Windows.
This document describes how develops should set up their tool chain to build xLights.



LINUX

You will need (use either package manager or "sudo apt-get install xxx")
  a) From the Ubuntu repository: build-essential & gdb packages

  b) Unforunately, the wxWidgets and code::blocks packages in the 
     Ubuntu respositories are too far out of date for use. 
     Therefore, you will need to follow the instructions at: 

        http://apt.jenslody.de/

     in order to get the latest wxWidgets and code::blocks packages.

     Make sure you get these packages:
        libwxgtk2.xx
        libwxgtk2.xx-dev 
        wx2.xx-headers
        wx-common
        wx2.xx-doc
        codeblocks
        codeblocks-contrib

  c) after loading the packages and the xLights source, you will
     need to compile the xLights serial port library:
     1) cd to the xLights/serial directory
     2) run: make -f makefile.linux

  d) now you are ready to use code::blocks to build
     each of the binaries (xMenu, xTester, xSchedule)



OS/X

You will need:
  a) instructions for installing code::blocks are here:
     http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Installing_Code::Blocks_from_source_on_Mac_OS_X




WINDOWS

You will need:
  a) MinGW compiler (a nice distro is here: http://nuwen.net/mingw.html)
  b) Code::Blocks for Windows (currently using 10.05)
  c) wxWidgets for Windows (currently using 2.8.11)
  d) If using wxPack, wxWidgets is precompiled. Otherwise, you will need
     to compile it yourself. To compile it yourself:
     1) Open a command prompt
     2) cd to the build\msw directory under your wxWidgets base directory
     3) run: mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc MONOLITHIC=1 SHARED=1 UNICODE=1 BUILD=debug
     4) run: mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc MONOLITHIC=1 SHARED=1 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release
  d) In Code::Blocks:
     1) select Settings > Compiler & Debugger
     2) click Search Directories tab
     3) Under Compiler sub-tab should be:
          $(#wx)\include
          $(#wx)\contrib\include
     4) Under Linker sub-tab should be:
          $(#wx)\lib\gcc_dll
     5) Make sure "wx" is defined under Settings > Global Variables
        as described in the Code::Blocks documentation. It should be
        set to your wxWidgets base directory.


SVN

Setting up SVN (all platforms):
  a) URL: https://xlights.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xlights/trunk
  b) If using Tortoise SVN on Windows, set the global ignore pattern to:
     *.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store *.exe .objs Thumbs.db *.dll release other_ico gcc_mswd *.depend *.layout
