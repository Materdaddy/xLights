VERSION 1 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (VERSIONS 2012B AND EARLIER)

xLights can be built and run on Linux, Mac OS/X, or Windows. This document
describes how **developers** should set up their tool chain to build xLights.
If you are a user, installation packages are available on the xLights
web site for Windows and Mac OS/X -- you can ignore the rest of this document.
Linux users will need to follow the instructions below to compile there own copy.


xLights is written in C++ and uses the wxWidgets library as a compatibility layer across operating systems.
xLights versions 2012a and EARLIER are compatible with wxWidgets 2.8.10, 2.8.11, and 2.8.12
xLights version 2012b is compatible with wxWidgets 2.8.11, 2.8.12, 2.9.3, and 2.9.4
wxWidgets versions 2.8.x are available as precompiled downloads from various locations on the internet.
wxWidgets versions 2.9.x are not considered stable and must be compiled yourself.


LINUX

These instructions are based on Linux Mint 12. Instructions for other Linux
distributions will vary. 

  a) Using Software Manager, install these packages: g++, subversion

  b) Using Software Manager, install libwxgtk2.8-dev (easier) OR download and compile wxWidgets 2.9.3 (more challenging)

  c) Get the xLights source code by opening a terminal window and typing the following:

     svn co https://xlights.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xlights/trunk xlights

xLights can be built 2 ways on Linux. First, you can use the supplied makefiles
to build it. This is sufficient to get xLights running, but not to modify it.
The second way is to install the Code::Blocks IDE and compile xLights within
the IDE. If you plan on modifying xLights yourself, this is the way to go.

To build xLights using the supplied makefiles:

  d) While still in the terminal window, cd to the new xlights directory
 
  e) Make the shell script executable by typing: chmod 766 makeall.sh

  f) Execute the shell script: ./makeall.sh
     You will get some compiler warnings, however, the 3 executables should
     get built in the ./bin directory.

Building xLights using Code::Blocks (if you want to edit the code)

  g) In Code::Blocks
     1) Make sure "wx" is defined under Settings > Global Variables
        as described in the Code::Blocks documentation. It should be
        set to your wxWidgets base directory (/usr/lib/wx on my system).

  h) Install libwxsmithlib0 to enable visual layout

  i) Now you are ready to use Code::Blocks to build
     each of the binaries (xMenu, xSchedule, xConverter)
     by double-clicking on the cbp file in each directory.
     In order for the double-click to work, you may need 
     to first right-click on the cbp file, select properties,
     and uncheck the box indicating that the file is runnable.
     Make sure you set the target to "Release Linux" before you build.



OS/X (Mac)

Unfortunately, xLights cannot be compiled using the OS/X cocoa libraries
due to bugs in wxWidgets. Ticket #13065 (wxMediaCtrl not ported to wxCocoa)
is the problem. Until the ticket is resolved, xLights must be compiled as a carbon app.

On OS/X, compilation is done using Xcode. Code::Blocks is not used.
Xcode can be downloaded from the Apple developer web site. Make
sure you install the version of Xcode that matches your version of
OS/X. For example, I use OS/X 10.6, so I installed Xcode 3.1.
Instructions are here:

  http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Installing_Xcode


OS/X comes with the wxWidgets libraries pre-installed. If you have
OS/X version 10.5 or higher, then xLights can use the version
of wxWidgets that comes with the OS and you can skip this step.
If you are using 10.4 or earlier, then you will need an updated
version of wxWidgets and this step is required. Note that after
performing this step, you will have 2 copies of wxWidgets on your
system and you will need to be very careful to access the correct one in
later steps. Use "./wx-config --version" to check which one you are accessing.
The instructions here suggest compiling with Xcode:
  http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Compiling_wxWidgets_with_Xcode

However, I followed the method used for Linux from inside a Terminal window:
  cd <wxMac base dir>
  ./configure --disable-shared --enable-universal-binary --enable-mediactrl
  make

Next, you will use Xcode to compile each of the xLights modules
(xMenu, xScheduler, xConverter). You will need to treat each one
as a separate project. Most of the steps are listed here:

  http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Creating_Xcode_projects_for_wxWidgets_applications

In addition to the instructions on the wiki page above, you will also need to:
  1) Fix the reference to the precompiled header file in each project. This can
     be done by double-clicking on the xxxTarget.xcconfig file and then changing
     the GCC_PREFIX_HEADER to wx_pch.h.
  2) When configuring the project for xScheduler, set "Other Linker Flags" to
     the output of: "./wx-config --libs std,media,aui".


WINDOWS

You will need:
  a) MinGW compiler (a nice distro is here: http://nuwen.net/mingw.html)
  b) Code::Blocks for Windows (was using 10.05, now using SVN 8484 available here: http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,17019.0.html)
  c) wxWidgets for Windows (currently using 2.9.4)
  d) Since we are now using the development version of wxWidgets, you will need
     to compile it yourself. To compile it yourself:
     1) Open a command prompt
     2) cd to the build\msw directory under your wxWidgets base directory
     3) run: mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc MONOLITHIC=1 SHARED=1 UNICODE=1 BUILD=debug
     4) run: mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc MONOLITHIC=1 SHARED=1 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release
        if you get errors then you need to update mingw binutils and make
  e) In Code::Blocks:
     1) select Settings > Compiler & Debugger
     2) click Search Directories tab
     3) Under Compiler sub-tab should be:
          $(#wx)\include
          $(#wx)\contrib\include
     4) Under Linker sub-tab should be:
          $(#wx)\lib\gcc_dll
     5) Make sure "wx" is defined under Settings > Global Variables
        as described in the Code::Blocks documentation. It should be
        set to your wxWidgets base directory.
  f) Now you are ready to use Code::Blocks to build
     each of the binaries (xMenu, xScheduler, xConverter)
     by double-clicking on the cbp file in each directory.



SVN

Setting up SVN (all platforms):
  a) URL: https://xlights.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xlights/trunk
  b) If using Tortoise SVN on Windows, set the global ignore pattern to:
     *.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store *.exe .objs Thumbs.db *.dll release other_ico gcc_mswd *.depend *.layout
